# SmartChain

My submission to Llama hack 2024 London.

SmartChain is an AI agent that helps protect renewable energy supply chains & ensure project success.

An often overlooked component of the green energy transition is the critical and ofen volatile supply chains that support it. Copper, a core ingredient in electrical wiring in essential components such as transformers can often fluctuate in price massively and often needs to be replaced wth alternatives such as Aluminium. Today, project directors rarely have the time or the tools to be able to monitor these files effectively, leading to unexpected costs, project overrun, and even cancellation. 

SmartChain aims to help fix this problem. 

SmartChain begins by building a large knowledge graph of insights, based on news articles, earnings calls, and more. From these it extracts a key set of insights into core materials used in the renewable project and notifies the user of any critical alerts. 

In addition to this, SmartChain collates a series of alternate products and monitors these as well, providing the data foundation for its agent assistant to work with. 

The user can ask SmartChain to perform a more in-depth analysis and assess the market situation. 

Once this is completed the user has the visibility to check the line of thinking before optionally making some edits and then taking the action, in this case entering a contract renegotiation and exploring other options in the materials.
